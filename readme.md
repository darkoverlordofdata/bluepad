# bluepad

Format and review multi page posts before posting to bluesky social

##

the core is based on browserpad (https://github.com/browserpad/browserpad)

this is intended as a seperate application from bluesky to provide physical isolation for the user.
i am able to work on a post without interuption from bluesky.
i have to login temporarily to post to make it intentional, no just pressing the post button.
